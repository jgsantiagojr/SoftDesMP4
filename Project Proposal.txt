What is the main idea of your project? What topics will you explore and what will you generate? What is your minimum viable product? What is a stretch goal?

We (Jamie and Adi) would like to make a clone of the retro game "Astroids."
We will explore creating different classes (like Controller and Debris), controlling them and modifiying the enviornment in which the user plays in.

Our MVP will consist of a ship that can navigate freely around the screen to avoid a constant stream of astroids. There will be some sort of score keeping device that relates to the time the player is alive.

Our stretch goal would be implementing different enemies and a shooter system that could possibly factor into score caluclations.


What are your learning goals for this project (for each member)?

Adi:
	- Develop a working understanding of using graphics and graphics libraries in Python3
	- Focusing on aesthetic in the final product

Jamie: 
	- Creating more universal classes 
	- Build proficiency at collecting user input
	- Creating "strategic randomness"




What libraries are you planning to use? (if you donâ€™t know enough yet, please outline how you will decide this question during the beginning phase of the project).

Libraries we curretnly plan on using:
	-Pygame
	-Time

We may use other libraries as specific needs arise



What do you plan to accomplish by the mid-project check-in? (See below for some generic goals; edit to suit your particular project)

Our goal is to have our MVP finished or close to working by the mid-project check in. This includes a working controller class, environment, and asteroids. 



What do you view as the biggest risks to you being successful on this project? How will you mitigate them?

The biggest risk is the break in the middle of the project. We have to allot some time over break to make some parts of the project work. By having a scheudule and setting the amount of work over break to be really low, we can still get things done on time.
