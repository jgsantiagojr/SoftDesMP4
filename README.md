Asteroid Clone by Jamie and Adi

In order to play our Asteroids Copy, you must make sure you have pygame downloaded onto your computer. Visit this link https://www.pygame.org/download.shtml or enter pip install pygame into your terminal

To play simply open the file in your terminal with the following command:
              python asteroids.py

It's a little buggy, but enjoy!
